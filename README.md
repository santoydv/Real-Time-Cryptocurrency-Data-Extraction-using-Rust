### Krypto Scrapper

1. Installed rust using the given reference link.
2. Understood the working of rust to went through the example of a web scraping tool.
3. Used the example as a reference to make my own tool and got the desired result.

#### Problems faced
Using the same meathod or using the `nth child` to retrive _24H Value_ and _Market cap_ was giving me the correct value for the 1st value of _Market cap_, so I had to run a for loop seperately with `next` and `nth child` functions for both of them to get all data accurately.
